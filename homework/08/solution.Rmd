# Problem 1: Weak selection

> Consider a population of size $N$ engaged in a two-player evolutionary game. The population consists of
> two types of individuals, $A$ and $B$, with frequencies $x_A$ and $x_B = 1âˆ’x_A$, respectively. The fitness of the
> two types depends on the payoffs from the game and is given by the payoff matrix:

$$
\bordermatrix{ & A & B \cr
A & a & b \cr
B & c & d \cr}
$$

> The average payoffs (fitness) of individuals of type $A$ and $B$, denoted by $f_A$ and $f_B$, respectively, are given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_A &= a x_A + b(1 - x_A) = ax_A + bx_B \\
f_B &= c x_A + d(1 - x_A) = cx_A + dx_B
\end{aligned}
$$

## (a) Write down the replicator equation for the change in the frequency $x_A$ of type $A$ in the population overtime.

Let $x := (x_A, x_B)$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d x_A}{dt} 
  &= x_A \left(f_A(x) - \phi(x)\right) \\
  &= x_A \left(
    f_A(x) - x_Af_A(x) - (1-x_A)f_B(x)
  \right) \\
  &= x_A (1 - x_A) \left(
    f_A(x) - f_B(x)
  \right) \\ 
  &= x_A (1 - x_A) \left(
    ax_A + b(1-x_A) - cx_A - d(1 -x_A)
  \right) \\
  &= x_A (1 - x_A) \left(
    (a - b - c + d)x_A + (b - d) 
  \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

## (b) Now assume weak selection, where the fitness is given by $1 + \delta f_i$, where $f_i$ is the payoff for type $i$ and $\delta$ is a small selection strength parameter. Linearize the replicator equation to first order in $\delta$.

Let $x := (x_A,x_B)$. Denote fitness as $F_i$ and average fitness as $\Phi$. We have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d x_A}{dt}
&= x_A[F_A(x) - \Phi(x)] \\
&= x_A\left[
  (1 + \delta f_A(x)) - (x_A (1 + \delta f_A(x)) + x_B (1 + \delta f_B(x))
\right] \\
&= x_A \left[
  (1 - x_A)(1 + \delta f_A(x)) - (1 - x_A) - (1-x_A)\delta f_B(x)
\right] \\
&= \delta x_A (1 - x_A) \left[
   f_A(x) - f_B(x)
\right] \\
&= \delta x_A (1 - x_A) \left[
  (a - b - c + d)x_A + (b - d)
\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

## (c) Determine the condition for evolutionary stability (ESS) of type $A$. What condition must the payoff parameters $a, b, c, d$ satisfy for $A$ to be evolutionary stable? How does this depend on the choice of $\delta$?

A is ESS if the following two conditions hold:

1. Selection protects against invasion by B: a single B mutant has lower fitness in a A population, i.e. $F_B < F_A$.
2. Selection protects against replacement -- according to the slides it means $x^* > 1/3$.

The two conditions translate to

1. $b > d$
2. $(d-b)/(a-b-c+d) > 1/3 \rightarrow d > (a + 2b - c)/2$

Seems like $\delta$ doesn't affect the condition for ESS.

## (d) Analyze condition for evolutionary stability.

> Suppose $A$ and $B$ represent two strategies in the classic Hawk-Dove ganme, with the following payoff matrix:

$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 & \text{Hawk} & \text{Dove} \\
\hline
\text{Hawk} & \frac{V-C}{2} & V \\
\text{Dove} & 0 & \frac{V}{2}
\end{array}
$$

> where $V$ is the value of the contested resource and $C$ is the cost of fighting. Analyze the condition for evolutionary stability under weak selection for this game.

---

Apply what we derived in the previous question, for Hawk to be ESS, we must have

1. $V > 0$
2. $V/2 > (V-C)/4 + V \rightarrow C > 3V$


# Problem 2: Strong selection

> Consider the two-strategy game

$$
\bordermatrix{ & A & B \cr
A & a & b \cr
B & c & d \cr}
$$

## (a) In an _infinite_ population with replicator dynamics, decide for all games of this type whether strategies $A$ and $B$ are dominant, coexisting or bi-stable, based on the two varaibles $\xi = a -c$ and $\zeta = d - b$.

Regurgitating lecture slides:

- $\xi > 0$, $\zeta > 0$: $A$ and $B$ are bi-stable ($a > c$, $d > b$)
- $\xi < 0$, $\zeta < 0$: $A$ and $B$ are coexisting ($a < c$, $d < b$)
- $\xi > 0$, $\zeta < 0$: $A$ is dominant ($a > c$, $d < b$)
- $\xi < 0$, $\zeta > 0$: $B$ is dominant ($a < c$, $d > b$)
- $\xi = 0$, $\zeta = 0$: $A$ and $B$ are neutral ($a = c$, $d = b$)

---

**(Problem (2) continued)**

> Now consider a population of _finite size_ $N$ that evolves according to an unstructured Moran process. Suppose the fitness of $A$ and $B$ are given respectively by

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_i &= \frac{a(i-1) + b(N-i)}{N-1} \\
g_i &= \frac{ci + d(N - i - 1)}{N-1}.
\end{aligned}
$$

> Note that this corresponds to limit of strong selection $w = 1$, as compared to the lecture. We want to classify the evolutionary stability of $A$ and $B$ as a function of the population size $N$ and the payoff values $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. To this end, we analyze the difference in fitness $h_i = f_i - g_i$.

## (b) Analyze the relationship between $h_i$, $\xi$, and $\zeta$.

> Show that

$$
h_i = \xi' \frac{i}{N - 1} - \zeta' \frac{N-i}{N-1}
$$

> with 

$$
\xi' = \xi - \frac{a-d}{n} \quad \text{and} \quad \zeta' = \zeta + \frac{a-d}{N}.
$$

---

\begin{proof}
$$
\begin{aligned}
h_i &= f_i - g_i \\
&= \frac{a(i-1) + b(N -i)}{N - 1} - 
   \frac{ci + d(N - i - 1)}{N - 1} \\
&= \frac{
  ai - a + bN - b - ci - dN + di + d
}{N -1} \\
&= \frac{
  (a - c)i - (d - b)(N - i) - (a - d)
}{N - 1} \\
&= \frac{
  (a-c)i - (d-b)(N-1) - (a-d)\cdot (N - i + i) / N
}{N - 1} \\ 
&= \frac{i}{N-1} \cdot \left(
  (a-c) - \frac{a-d}{N}
\right) - \frac{N-i}{N-1} \cdot \left(
 (d-b) + \frac{a-d}{N}
\right) \\
&= \xi' \frac{i}{N - 1} - \zeta' \frac{N-i}{N-1}
\end{aligned}
$$
\end{proof}

## (c) Show that for $\xi' > 0 > \zeta'$, strategy $A$ is dominant. Derive a criterion for the dominance of $B$.

Given $\xi' > 0 > \zeta'$, we have $h_i > 0$ since it becomes the sum of two positive numbers, which means that $A$ is dominant by the definition of $h_i$ ($f_i > g_i$).

For $B$ to be dominant, we must have $f_i < g_i$ i.e. $h_i < 0$. This means that $\xi' < 0$ and $\zeta' > 0$.


# Problem 3: Hawk-Dove game example

> Consider an (infinite) population where individuals can adopt one of two strategies: Hawk (H) or Dove (D). They payoff matrix for interactions between individuals using these strategies is given by:

$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 & \text{Hawk} & \text{Dove} \\
\hline
\text{Hawk} & \frac{V-C}{2} & V \\
\text{Dove} & 0 & \frac{V}{2}
\end{array}
$$

> where V is the value of the resource $V > 0$ and $C$ is the cost of the conflict. Assume $V < C$. Which (if any) of the following statements is true regarding the conditions for an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) in this game? Please provide a proper rationale for your answer.

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\Alph{enumi})}
  \item Strategy Hawk (H) is an ESS if $(V-C)/2 > 0$ and $V \geq V/2$
  \item Strategy Dove (D) is an ESS if $V/2 > 0$ and $0 \geq V$
  \item Strategy Hawk (H) is an ESS if $(V-C)/2 > V$ and $V \geq V/2$
  \item Strategy Dove (D) is an ESS if $V/2 > 0$ and $0 \geq (V-C)/2$
\end{enumerate}

---

Regurgitating the lecture slides:

$S_k$ is an ESS if $\forall i \neq k$, either

- $a_{kk} > a_{ik}$, or
- $a_{kk} = a_{ik}$ and $a_{ki} > a_{ii}$

In the Hawk-Dove game settings, if we want strategy $H$ to be an ESS, we must have

- $(V-C)/2 > V \rightarrow V < -C$
- $(V-C)/2 = V \rightarrow V = -C$ and $V > V/2$ (trivially true)

We can see that when $C > V > 0$, neither of the conditions are satisfied, so strategy $H$ is never an ESS.

For strategy $D$ to be an ESS, we must have

- $V/2 > 0$, or
- $V/2 = 0 \rightarrow V = 0$ and $(V-C)/2 < 0$.

We can see that when $C > V > 0$, the first condition is satisfied, so strategy $D$ is an ESS.

Following the retionale, the correct answer is $\boxed{\text{D}}$.
